  For our capstone project, our team sought to develop a machine learning model that would predict the likelihood of heart disease in subjects
  based on their personal characteristics. Inherent bias of the selected dataset include uneven feature distribution as the majority of the dataset 
  was comprised of No Heart Disease (1) individuals. Because of this, multiple models were evaluated to find an optimal ML model 
  that had high accuracy, precision, and recall. We evaluated multiple ML models and hyper-parameters for the ability to predict positive and negative diagnosis 
  of Heart Disease. The final model used in this project is a Logistic Regression model that utilizes SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) 
  to deal with an imbalanced class set.
